# Lecture 1. Introduction

* Algorithm: 
    * A algorithm is a some kind of function, takes some inputs, maps to correct outputs to solve problem.

* Efficiency:
    * Efficiency not only means how fast does the algorithm run, but how fast does it compare to other algorithms solving the same problem.
    * Do not measure time, instead count operations.
    * We expect performance to depend on size of input. 
## Asymptotic notation

O() upper bound; Ω() Lower bound;  Θ both.
